#  ðŸ¦Ž chameleon-linter

## What it is?
- A tiny Nodejs CLI app

## What it is not?
- Definitely not eslint!
    - This module will scan for .js files in the root of your project folder and log issues in the console
    - It has only two linting rules for .js files which are:
        - All lines must be terminated with a semi-colon
        - All assignment operators must have spaces on either end

## Installation
- At the root of your project folder run the command:
```npm install chameleon-linting```
if using *npm*, otherwise if using *yarn* use the command:
```yard add chameleon-linting```
- Run the command:
```npx chameleon-linter```
to scan and lint file in the root of ypur projects folder.

Enjoy!!!
