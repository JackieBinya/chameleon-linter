#  🦎 chameleon-linter

## What it is?
- A tiny Nodejs CLI linting app.

## What it is not?
- Definitely not eslint!
    - This module will scan for .js files in the root of your project folder and log issues in the console
    - It has only two linting rules for .js files which are:
        - All lines must be terminated with a semi-colon.
        - All assignment operators must have spaces on either end.

## Installation 🧚🏾‍♀️
- At the root of your project folder run the command:
```npm install chameleon-linting```

If using *npm*, otherwise if using *yarn* use the command:
```yard add chameleon-linting```

## Let's get linting! 🕵️-

```npx chameleon-linter```
